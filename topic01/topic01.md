# Topic of this video:
# [fit] Latency and Laws of Physics

---

# [fit] Speed of light in vacuum $$c$$
# [fit] 299 792 458 [m/s]
# [fit] This is a definition, *not* a measured value

---

# Refractive indices of materials

* $$v$$: speed of light in a material
* Refractive index $$n = c / v$$, always $$n \geq 1$$!
* Air: 1.000279 for λ=0.50 µm [^1] -> 299709 km/s
* Water: 1.3330 for λ=589.3 nm [^1] -> 224901 km/s
* Silica glass (optic fiber): 1.45 [^2] -> 206753 km/s

# Distance latency and timing

* Osaka to Tokyo: ~400km = ~1.3ms (in vacuum/air)
* Tokyo, Japan to San Francisco, CA, USA: ~8300km ~= 28ms (in vacuum/air), 41ms (in silica glass)
* Japan <-> USA in optic fiber, round trip: ~100ms or more
* *Synchronization is hard*

---

# Light traveling time and distance
# [fit] wiring and wavelength matter

* ~300km in 1ms aka 1kHz
* ~300m in 1µs aka 1MHz
* ~30cm in 1ns aka 1GHz
* ~3mm in 1ps aka 1THz
