# Topic of this video:
# [fit] Multiplexing

---

# Multiplexing: sharing the same link by multiple nodes and communication devices

---

![right fit](network-decentralized.png)

# Multiplexing enables decentralization

- Some links carry shared traffics for many different nodes

---

# How to multiplex different types of information, and put them together for sharing a same medium?

---

# Signal characteristics used for multiplexing

* Space division (multiple lines or multiple beam-formed antennas)
* Time division
* Frequency/wavelength division
* Polarization division
* Code division (multiple codes of very small cross-correlation)
