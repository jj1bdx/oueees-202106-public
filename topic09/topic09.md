# Is cloud really a uniform and single entity?

---

![original fit](Cloud_Computing-slide.jpg)

# Absolutely not: it's an intertwined *network* of computers

---

# Web services are clusters of computers and networks

Thousands or millions of servers connected together

A physical server is separated into multiple virtual machines

---

# Cloud computing *is* centralization

---

# An example of cloud computing: Internet of Things (IoT) and telemetering

![original fit](telemetering.jpg)

---

# Telemetering

* Mostly unidirectional (not really *the true and genuine internet*)
* Sensors/devices gathering data through internet and feed them to the servers in the cloud computing platforms
* *The servers compute*
* *Extremely centralized*
