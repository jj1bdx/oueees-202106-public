<!-- talk contents here -->
## Centralized social behavior accerelated by cloud computing

* Sharing *everything* - no privacy
* *Panopticon* [^1] style of governance, filtering, *censorship, or autocracy*
* Complete *externalization* of resources, leading to *no personal control*

[^1]: n. a circular prison with cells arranged around a central well, from which prisoners could at all times be observed. (New Oxford American Dictionary, Apple macOS 10.13.6)

# INGSOC: the slogans [^2]

* War is peace
* Freedom is slavery
* Ignorance is strength

* Independent thinking = *thoughtcrime*

## NOTE: this is a *fiction*!

[^2]: George Orwell, "Nineteen Eighty-Four", 1949.

# Why cloud computing has become so *dystopian*? -- because we have sold freedom for *convenience*

* Ubiquitous/global accessibility
* Concentrated data for easy analysis
* Easy control of the information flow
* No extra cost for sharing
* No need to think about where the information locates

# The inconvenient truth of centralized systems: what if the core/cloud fails?

![right](When-core-fails.png)

---

## Inconvenience of centralized systems

* Ubiquity or *no accessibility*
* When the core fails, no alternative
* When the core loses data, *no backup*
* The system performance is restricted by the capability of the core
* Endpoint systems will lost *all capabilities*

---

# Centralized systems are *not* sustainable

- ...then how cloud computing systems manages the sustainability?

---

# Distributed systems provide sustainability and resilience against failures
