# [fit] Why learning programming?
# [fit] Programming = making software
# [fit] Programming is the only way to fabricate a system
# [fit] Computers can only do their job through programming 
# [fit] It's often *you* need to write the code, not somebody else

---

# [fit] Programming is a
# [fit] language
# [fit] There are various languages which fit and don't fit your requirement
# [fit] There are no good or bad programming languages

---

# [fit] Modern software development:
# [fit] team, library, and ecosystem

* Development as a *team*, not just individual
* Depending on *libraries*, not just newly-written code
* Depending on the *ecosystem*, not just you and your team

---

# So what to learn?

* Popular ones (C++, JavaScript, Python, etc.)
* *Required* ones by your tasks (old languages)
* For experiments and prototyping (esoteric languages)
* Learning a programming language can change your mind

---

# My suggestions: Erlang/Elixir for concurrency

* Concurrency is the key for distributed network programming
* Erlang for learning the basic functional programming
* Elixir for applying functional programming for web
* Disclaimer: these languages are not necessarily popular, but will surely change how you understand computer programming
