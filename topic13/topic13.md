# [fit] Wireless/radio and internet

![original](tekniskamuseet_telefontornet.jpg)

# [fit] Direct wired network at the maximum extent
# [fit] This is the old Stockholm telephone tower in 1890 (see Topic 02)

---

# [fit] Lessons learned: wired networks do not necessarily scale well

* Difficult to install, often impossible
* Easily get cut/disconnected by accidents
* Difficult to reconfigure/rewire
* Individual link management is complex and often erratically done

---

# [fit] Remove the wire!

---

# [fit] Wireless/radio networks
# [fit] as a replacement of wired networks

---

# Limitations of radio networks by physics

* Speed limited by radio frequency bandwidth
* Latency increased by (de)modulation and packetization
* Excessively large error rate due to obstacles (burst errors), fading, interference, and etc.: *Error-correction encoding required*
* Radiation spillover causes content disclosure: *encryption required*
* The source of interference is immensely difficult to locate
* Still requires a lot of wiring to the base stations

# [fit] Advantages of radio networks:
# [fit] Mobility

* Providing connections to where no wires can connect
* Nodes can move around while maintaining the connectivity

---

# [fit] Implementation issues to overcome for 5G era:
# [fit] Low channel capacity and short reachability 

* Trade-off between frequency bandwidth, reachable range, and base station installation
* Massive interference between nodes and networks
* Latency issues due to (de)modulation will persistently remain
